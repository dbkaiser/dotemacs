dotemacs
========
The emacs dot file created by Douglas

The el-get is a easy way to organize your el packages, but it requires some pre-build tools:

Includes but not limit:

    $ sudo apt-get install bzr build-essential cvs subversion git libxml2 libxml2-dev automake autoconf libtool install-info libtinfo5 libtinfo-dev libncurses5 libncurses5-dev 

The first couple of time of start the emacs with this dotfiles will take some time for emacs to download and install required packages. If it occurs error, please quit and reenter.

The el-get.tgz file is for el-get bin files in case the various kinds of scm tool don't work
